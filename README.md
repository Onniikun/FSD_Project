# Team name: React Muna

## Group members:

Nathan Natoza, Edraque Maglaque, Phoenixx Ordonez

## Project Theme: Music Sharing App

## User Stories:

1. As an avid music listener, I want to share my songs links across different applications, so that I can share them easily with people who use different music platforms.

2. As a user, I want to see a navigation bar, so that I can find and switch between pages with ease.

3. As a self-proclaimed music critic, I want to be able to view and submit reviews for music, so that I can freely share my opinions and see feedback from other users before deciding what to listen to.


# Project Documentation

Currently this full-stack project is separate into two different project files called 'frontend' and 'backend'

# Local Setup Instructions
Step 0 Download prerequisites: Download VScode and docker. These are the applications we use to create our project. 

Note: This is a react vite project which acts a little differently from a normal html project. This simple setup instructions will help provide you with the necessary information to test and use our project locally.

Step 0.5: Download unzip the project files and open that in VScode.
Now that you are in the root file of the project in VScode you'll see on the right hand side of your project files/folders; it should look something like this:
```
├── 📁 apps
│   ├── 📁 backend
│   └── 📁 frontend
├── 📁 docs
│   ├── 📝 architecture-nn.md
│   └── 📝 architecture-po.md
├── 📁 shared
│   └── 📁 types
│       ├── 📄 SongItemSchema.ts
│       └── 📄 songListTypes.ts
├── ⚙️ .gitignore
├── 📝 README.md
├── 📝 STYLEGUIDE.MD
├── ⚙️ docker-compose.yml
├── ⚙️ package-lock.json
├── ⚙️ package.json
├── ⚙️ tsconfig.base.json
└── ⚙️ tsconfig.json
```

Step 1: Front-end setup

Now that you have seen our project files we want to access the VScode terminal use the command ctrl+j or Command (⌘) + J if you're on mac.

it should look like this: ```PS C:\Users\domin\Desktop\FSD_Project> ```

use the ```cd apps/frontend``` command to get into the frontend directory.

it should look like this: ```PS C:\Users\domin\Desktop\FSD_Project\apps\frontend>```

Then use the ```npm install``` command. This should download our frontend dependencies on which project relies on. You will know that it worked when you opened the frontend you will see the huge file called ```node_modules```

After installing you need to create a .env file within the frontend directory. This is where we keep our environment variables; make sure you create it that follows the same path to prevent issues.
```apps\frontend\.env``` 

After creating that you need two different environment variable keys in order for our application to work correctly. 

For the first env variable we need an VITE API URL to host the application; in our project we have it called: ```VITE_API_BASE_URL```\
In the .env you created. Copy that and paste it into your .env file: ```VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000```

For the second environment variable, you need to create a Clerk application to work with the frontend. [Link Here](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up)

Once you have completed creating your account, setup a clerk application. Note that you need to select 'react' when creating the application; you don't need to follow the setup that clerk provides but you do need the clerk API, it should look something like this ```VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_ABC...```

Copy that and paste it into your .env file. Your .env should have these elements. 
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_ABC...
```

Now go back to your VScode terminal and run this command ```npm run dev```.
This will open the local host link and should look something like this: ```Local:   http://localhost:5173/```

And Thats the frontend setup!

Step 2: Back-end setup

Step 3: Docker + prisma database setup
